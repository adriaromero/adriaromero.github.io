<!-- ## About Me -->

<img src="images/adria.jpg" height="250" width="250" align="right">

‚úîÔ∏è My **Mission**: Empower society with smarter technology every day.
üîÜ My **Vision**: Drive inherent transformation and unique growth to the tech industry. <br>
üå† My **Passion**: Use data and technology to answer the "why" behind complex business problems.

üë®‚Äçüíª Currently, I am a Product Data Scientist at [Triage](https://www.triage.com/), bringing AI technologies to healthcare products. At Triage, I develop artificial intelligence solutions for dermatology that keep learning and making better predictions from users every day.

üåÉ At nights, I curate [Productize ML](https://productize.ml/), an instruction guide for Developers and Product Managers building Machine Learning products.

üí° I love using innovative thinking, strategic planning, and data-driven decision making to help support the businesses and projects that I work on, both personally and professionally. Nothing makes me happier than to know that what I implement can make processes more efficient and that I create insight into KPIs that improve business function.

üéì I am currently enrolled in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science ([OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/)) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) graduating in December 2021. In 2017, I graduated from [Polytechnic University of Catalonia](https://www.upc.edu/en) in Electrical Engineering. I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis at [Florida Atlantic University](http://www.ceecs.fau.edu/) about Deep Learning techniques applied to Medical Imaging in 2016.

<blockquote> Skin disorders are one of the most common reasons why patients visit their primary care physicians. 1 in
3 cancer diagnoses is skin cancer and 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. The average wait time
to see a dermatologist in the United States is 1 month and even greater in other parts of the world. In that time skin
disorders can worsen or become life threatening. The recent emergence of machine learning and deep learning methods for
medical image analysis has enabled the development of intelligent medical imaging-based diagnosis systems that can assist
physicians in making better decisions about a patient‚Äôs health. In particular, skin imaging is a field where these new
methods can be applied with a high rate of success. In this talk you will learn how Triage, a Toronto based startup
is using deep learning to diagnose any skin disease through real case studies, few months prior to become one of the
first healthcare companies using AI to be approved by the U.S. Food & Drugs Administration (FDA).

<blockquote> This project attempts to present an artistic representation of Mars after undergoing terraforming by humans.
As a result of this planetary engineering technique, Mars‚Äôs surface would adopt a more habitable appearance, similar to
that of the Earth. As an atmosphere is built and temperatures rise, the water cycle begins to take form. Clouds develop,
mountains become covered in snow, rivers start flowing down to the green covered fields, and the rocky Martian deserts
are replaced by trees and forests.
The recreation of that process was performed using an approach based on image to image translation trained on a dataset
based on images of Earth and Mars (fiction and NASA). </blockquote>

front end tool where users can choose various style options (e.g. Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, etc.) including converting
Earth images to other planets and vice versa. We also have some options to convert images into an artistic impression
(e.g. Picasso, Kandinsky, Van Gogh, da Vinci, etc.) of the image. </blockquote>

<div id="bsc-thesis" style="display:none;">
<blockquote> The recent emergence of machine learning and deep learning methods for medical image analysis has enabled
the development of intelligent medical imaging-based diagnosis systems that can assist physicians in making better
decisions about a patient‚Äôs health. In particular, skin imaging is a field where these new methods can be applied with
a high rate of success.

This thesis focuses on the problem of automatic skin lesion detection, particularly on melanoma detection, by applying
semantic segmentation and classification from dermoscopic images using a deep learning based approach.
For the first problem, a U-Net convolutional neural network architecture is applied for an accurate extraction of the
lesion region. For the second problem, the current model performs a binary classification (benign versus malignant) that
can be used for early melanoma detection. The model is general enough to be extended to multi-class skin lesion
classification. The proposed solution is built around the VGG-Net ConvNet architecture and uses the transfer learning
paradigm. Finally, this work performs a comparative evaluation of classifica- tion alone (using the entire image)
against a combination of the two approaches (segmentation followed by classification) in order to assess which of
them achieves better classification results.

Experimental results for the classification task are encouraging: on the ISIC Archive dataset, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy in the top three of the best previously published results. The experimental results of the
segmentation evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform other state-of-the-art models.</blockquote>

<blockquote> We investigated the hypothesis that segmentation improves classification performance of skin lesions
using convolutional neural networks. Examination of classification using different degrees of
segmentation on images from the ISIC Archive dataset with the VGG-16 architecture revealed
unexpected results. Early results indicate that the highest classification performance occurs when a preclassification
segmentation and an unconventional subsequent dilation of the segmentation region is
performed. </blockquote>
